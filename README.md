# Customer-_Analysis
This project focuses on analyzing customer behavior and preferences using machine learning techniques. 
We conducted unsupervised clustering to group customers based on various factors such as family structures, income levels, and spending habits.
Using these clusters, we created detailed customer profiles.
The insights gained from this analysis can be incredibly valuable for businesses aiming to tailor their marketing strategies effectively.
